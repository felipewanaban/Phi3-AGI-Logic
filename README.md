### 🌌 The Discovery
After three years of reverse-engineering complex adaptive systems, we have confirmed a single, isomorphic pattern governing reality across scales. The **astonishing** discovery is that the same computational logic driving biological evolution, quantum measurement, and neural development is strictly required for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

This repository documents **$\Phi^3$ (Phi-Cubed)**: the formal proof that existence computes itself through a recursive loop of **Generation, Validation, and Filtering (G-V-F)**.

### ⚡ The Universal Law
Incompleteness is not a bug; it is the generative engine of the universe. [cite_start]Any system maintaining coherence while facing uncertain futures *must* implement this architecture to survive [cite: 1421-1422, 2440, 3570].
